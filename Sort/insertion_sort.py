# Insertion Sort
# Explanation:
# Insertion Sort builds a sorted array one element at a time by comparing each new element with the already sorted portion and inserting it into the correct position.
# Applications:
# Small datasets.
# Partially sorted arrays.
# Real-time systems, as it can sort during insertion.
# Advantages:
# Simple and easy to implement.
# Efficient for small and nearly sorted arrays.
# Stable sort.
# Disadvantages:
# Inefficient for large datasets.
# Time Complexity:
# Best Case: O(n) (when the array is nearly sorted)
# Average Case: O(nÂ²)
# Worst Case: O(nÂ²)
# Space Complexity:
# O(1) (in-place sorting)
